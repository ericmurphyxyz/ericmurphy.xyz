title: "Hey, I'm Eric."
description: "I'm a **web developer** and **YouTuber**. I try to make things like making websites and Linux simple enough for anyone to understand.\n\n

This website is meant to be my **\"home base\"** on the internet. I'll post some thoughts about things I'm interested in, whether it's about desktop Linux, building minimalistic websites, or books I'm currently reading."
